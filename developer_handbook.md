# Circles - The Developer Handbook

Hi there! If you're reading this, then you're probably one of the delta devs. And if you're one of the delta devs, you'll probably be writing lots and lots of code. And if you're writing lots and lots of code and haven't read this, you're probably doing it wrong. It's a mathematical certainty.

Have a printer? Print this out and hang it on the ceiling above your bed. Have a phone? Record this as a voice memo and set it as your ring signal, alarm clock and make sure it's the only track in your music app. Have a significant other? Get T-shirts made with different sections of the handbook for each day of the week, and stare at their chest until they feel uncomfortable. Then keep staring. 

In all seriousness, this is supposed to be a reference for anyone working on the project. If a decision has been made about coding style or workflow, you will (at least in theory) find it here. If you find yourself uncertain about this kind of stuff whilst developing, this should be the first place you look for answers.

Happy hacking! :)

## Workflow

### Github is king
Any and all communication relevant to the project that can be made public (including but not limited to questions about the code, the way we do things, bug reports etc.) should go through Github. For example:

 - You're not sure whether you should indent with tabs or spaces, and can't find anything about that in the DH. So, you open an issue stating that the DH is missing this information.
 - You've fixed a bug in production code and are not sure which branches you should merge into once you've fixed it. Again, open an issue.

**Do not** send an email, SMS, or Instagram to the lead developer, project manager or anyone else. There are two reasons for this: one, we hate it when you do it, and two, if you use Github then everybody gets to learn from the discussion which means we don't have to write the same thing five times to five different people. Everybody wins :)

Of course, if you want to discuss things "behind closed doors", Github is not the place to do it. Keep it civil.
